# Tanstack Start + Spring Boot Demo

This repository is a working demo of a full-stack application:

- Tanstack Start + React Query
- Orval (OpenAPI code generator for TypeScript)
- Spring Boot + OpenAPI

## Running the application

Client (Tanstack Start):

```bash
cd tanstack-start-client-app
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Server (Spring Boot):

- I prefer using IntelliJ to run the server
- But you can also use VSCode to run

## Features

Tanstack Start:

- React Query: Data fetching and caching
- Orval: Type-safe API client generation from OpenAPI spec

Spring Boot:

- OpenAPI: API documentation and contract
- Security: Basic auth, CSRF protection for SPA, and CORS configuration
